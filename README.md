Obesity is a medical condition, sometimes considered a disease, in which excess body fat has accumulated to such an extent that it can potentially have negative effects on health [1]. People are classified as obese when their body mass index (BMI)[2]—a person's weight divided by the square of the person's height—is over 30 kg/m2; the range 25–30 kg/m2 is defined as overweight[3]. The most commonly used definitions, established by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1997 and published in 2000, provide the values listed in the table below [4].

| Category          | BMI $(kg/m^2)$ |
|-------------------|:--------------:|
| Underweight       |     < 18.5     |
| Normal weight     |   18.5 – 24.9  |
| Overweight        |   25.0 – 29.9  |
| Obese (Class I)   |   30.0 – 34.9  |
| Obese (Class II)  |   35.0 – 39.9  |
| Obese (Class III) |     ≥ 40.0     |

In this study we'll try to come up with a model that predicts the risk of obesity by using the given data.
